# learning-about-version-control
Created as exercise for DSCI 522

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

**Why I like most about version control:** Everything is documented via commits and you can easily go back to a previous version if you want to undo a change (as opposed to relying on yourself to save multiple copies of the document on your computer)

**What I find most challenging/frustrating about version control:** It can sometimes be difficult to deal with merge conflicts (e.g., when you accidentally forget to pull from the repo before working on a document).
